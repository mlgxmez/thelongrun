With fastpages you can save your jupyter notebooks into the _notebooks folder at the root of your repository, and they will be automatically be converted to Jekyll compliant blog posts! . Front Matter . The first cell in your Jupyter Notebook or markdown blog post contains front matter. Front matter is metadata that can turn on/off options in your Notebook. It is formatted like this: . # &quot;My Title&quot; &gt; &quot;Awesome summary&quot; - toc:true- branch: master - badges: true - comments: true - author: Hamel Husain &amp; Jeremy Howard - categories: [fastpages, jupyter] . Setting toc: true will automatically generate a table of contents | Setting badges: true will automatically include GitHub and Google Colab links to your notebook. | Setting comments: true will enable commenting on your blog post, powered by utterances. | . The title and description need to be enclosed in double quotes only if they include special characters such as a colon. More details and options for front matter can be viewed on the front matter section of the README. . Markdown Shortcuts . A #hide comment at the top of any code cell will hide both the input and output of that cell in your blog post. .

Where YEAR is a four-digit number, MONTH and DAY are both two-digit numbers, and filename is whatever file name you choose, to remind yourself what this post is about. .md is the file extension for markdown files. . The first line of the file should start with a single hash character, then a space, then your title. This is how you create a “level 1 heading” in markdown. Then you can create level 2, 3, etc headings as you wish but repeating the hash character, such as you see in the line ## File names above. . Basic formatting .

            "title": "Maximum Likelihood estimation with TensorFlow",
            "content": "What to do when they give you a dataset and they ask you to model its distribution? . Start off by plotting a histogram your dataset. The distribution of values should be familiar to you... unless you have overlooked all the families of distributions out there. As discussed in the post on random variables, every distribution is defined by a set of parameters. The values of such parameters can be estimated with the technique called Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE). . To do that, we will introduce the Bayes&#39; theorem: . $$ p( theta vert D) = frac{p(D vert theta)p( theta)}{p(D)} $$Starting on the right-hand side: . $p(D vert theta)$ is the likelihood function. It measures how likely it is that $D$ has been generated from a certain distribution with parameters $ theta$. | $p( theta)$ is the prior distribution. Here you specify the a priori knowledge you have about your parameters. Your parameters are random variables and you need to define what are the values (and their probabilities) those parameters can have. | $p(D)$ is a normalization constant. It can be estimated by a weighted sum of all the conditional probabilities of your data for each the possible value of your parameters. The weights are the prior probabilities at each value. For MLE, this component is not that important. | . On the left-hand side: . $p( theta vert D)$ is the posterior distribution. Once you get information about your data you can update the estimate of the distribution of your parameters. | . As the name of this technique suggests, we are interested in estimating the values of the parameters that maximize the likelihood function. Mathematically speaking: $$ hat{ theta}_{ML} = argmax_{ theta} ; p(D vert theta) $$ . Depending on the complexity of the true distribution, a closed-form solution to this problem can be found. This notebook will teach you how to find a good estimate of $ theta$ using TensorFlow Probability. . Problem setup . . Note: Although this is a toy problem, the code can be adapted to suit your needs . import tensorflow as tf import tensorflow_probability as tfp tfd = tfp.distributions tf.executing_eagerly() . True . Helper functions . params_to_func = {&#39;mu&#39;: tf.math.reduce_mean, &#39;sigma&#39;:tf.math.reduce_std, &#39;rate&#39;: tf.math.reduce_mean} colors_encoding=[&#39;b&#39;,&#39;m&#39;,&#39;g&#39;] . def loss(model, data): total_log_prob = -tf.reduce_mean(model.log_prob(data)) return total_log_prob def grad(model, inputs): with tf.GradientTape() as tape: loss_value = loss(model, inputs) return loss_value, tape.gradient(loss_value, model.trainable_variables) def mle_run(data, model, parameters, optimizer, steps=1000, verbose=False): update_list = [] prob_values = [] value_range = tf.linspace(tf.reduce_min(data),tf.reduce_max(data), 100) for i in range(steps): loss_value, grads = grad(model, data) optimizer.apply_gradients(zip(grads, parameters)) if i % 10 == 0: update_list.append(( optimizer.iterations.numpy(),loss_value.numpy(), *[p.numpy()[0] for p in parameters])) param_str = &quot;, &quot;.join([p.name.split(&#39;:&#39;)[0]+&quot;: &quot;+str(p.numpy()) for p in parameters]) iter_info = f&quot;Step: {optimizer.iterations.numpy()}, initial loss: {loss_value.numpy()}, {param_str}&quot; if verbose: print(iter_info) prob_values.append(model.prob(value_range)) return update_list, prob_values, value_range . To fit our data to a dsitribution, we use two functions: . A loss function, here defined as the loss(...) function. You will notice we are using the log-probability of the likelihood function. This performs the maximization of the likelihood function as discussed above, but using a workaround. TensorFlow optimization operation is a minimization process. We instead minimize the negative log-likelihood but both ways accomplish the same result. Using the log-probability instead of raw probabilities deters from running into underflow issues when calculating the likelihood of hundreds of data points. The loss function will depend on the data and parameters that have been declared. | A function to record the gradients. These gradients are calculated by differentiation of the loss function with respect to the parameters and lets you update the parameters during the learning process. The tape object from TensorFlow takes care of everything as shown in the code. This process is called Automatic Differentiation. | . In each step during training, the grad(...) function returns the loss and the gradients, and apply_gradients(...) uses the Adam optimizer to update the parameters of the model. And mle_run(...) is a wrapper to handle that connects all the steps in the training process. . # Code adapted from: https://alexgude.com/blog/matplotlib-blitting-supernova/ from functools import partial from collections import namedtuple import matplotlib.pyplot as plt from matplotlib import animation def init_fig(f, ax, artists, data): freq, bins, _ = plt.hist(data, bins=50, density = True); # Set axis and plot titles ax.set_title(&quot;Fitting data with Maximum Likelihood&quot;, fontsize=20) ax.set_xlabel(&quot;Values of the distribution&quot;, fontsize=14) ax.set_ylabel(r&quot;$p(D| theta)$&quot;, fontsize=14) ax.set_xlim((tf.reduce_min(data)-0.1*tf.math.abs(tf.reduce_min(data))).numpy(), (tf.reduce_max(data)+0.1*tf.math.abs(tf.reduce_max(data))).numpy() ) ax.set_ylim(0.,freq.max()) return artists def frame_iter(update_list, prob_values): for i in range(len(prob_values)): yield (update_list[i][0], prob_values[i]) def update_artists(frames, artists, value_range): s, p = frames artists.prob.set_data(value_range.numpy(), p) artists.step.set_text(&quot;Step &quot; + str(s)) # Function to plot learning curves def plot_curves(update_lists, data, params_list): from pandas import DataFrame param_names = [p.name.split(&#39;:&#39;)[0] for p in params_list] learning_df = DataFrame(update_lists, columns=[&quot;Step&quot;, &quot;Loss&quot;, *param_names]) f, ax = plt.subplots(1+len(params_list), 1, sharex = True, figsize=(16, 8)) learning_df.plot(x = &quot;Step&quot;, y=&#39;Loss&#39;,style=&quot;r--X&quot; ,ax=ax[0]) for i, p in enumerate(param_names): learning_df.plot(x = &quot;Step&quot;, y=p, style=f&quot;{colors_encoding[i]}--*&quot;,linewidth=3,ax=ax[i+1]) ax[i+1].axhline(params_to_func[p](data).numpy(), color=colors_encoding[i]) ax[i+1].legend([f&quot;MLE {p}&quot;,f&quot;True {p}&quot;]) plt.tight_layout() .

            "content": "Introduction to random variables for non-data scientists . . Me: Hey, just took a pic in the library! Look at how old and dusty are these books! . You: Are these the oldest ones you found in there . Me: No, I didn’t inspect all of them. just picked these five. . You: Look! In the background you can see plenty of them. How many books do you think there were in the library? . Me: Uh, I don’t know…Maybe between 3000 and 5000? . :clapper: Cut! . That’s not a scene from a movie. My intention was to develop some intiuition on what random variables are, because this concept will appear again and again in this blog. . To define a random variable, it’s better to start defining the opposite of a random variable. . A deterministic variable is a variable we are 100% sure about its value. | A random variable is characterized by absence of complete data, but we can provide an estimate of its true value based on intuition or past experiences. | . In short, a deterministic variable is defined by a single value (like a number, text or date). A random variable is defined with a probability distribution over a range of values. This distribution represents what are the possible values a variable can get, each value has probability linked to. . Going back to the short dialogue, there were five books. We call the number of books in the picture a deterministic variable. This is how we represent that variable with a probability distribution. . . The number of books in the whole library is actually higher. I didn’t count all of them. I provided an estimate. The factors that led to that estimate (between 3000 and 5000) could be the size of the library, or average thickness of book’s spine. In any case, that estimate could be represented with the followng probability distribution. . . That’s a uniform distribution. In simple terms, it means “the probability of the library having 3000 books is as likely as having 5000 or any other quantity in between”. . . That’s a normal distribution. It can be interpreted as “the number of books is between 3000 and 5000 but we are more certain that this quantity is somewhere in the middle”. . Probability distributions have the following properties: . Probability values are bounded between 0 and 1. | The area under the curve of normalized probability distribution is equal to 1 | . Warning When the value range is lower than one the first property is violated in favor of the second one. . Random variables with TensorFlow Probability . TensorFlow is one of the most popular frameworks for numerical computation and machine learning. What makes TensorFlow Probability unique are the capabilities to do probabilistic programming. A programming paradigm where you can define random variables. . import tensorflow as tf import tensorflow_probability as tf deterministic_var = tf.Variable(5.) # Books in the picture random_var = tfd.Normal(4000.0, 500.0) # Books in the library . The normal distribution models the number of books in the library. random_var requires two arguments: the mean and the standard deviation of the distribution. . TensorFlow Probability has a list of functions to interact with random variables. Use them carefully: . # Returns the mean of the random variable random_var.mean() # Returns the mode of the random variable random_var.mode() # Likelihood (probability) that the random variable is equal to 3300 random_var.prob(3300) # Probability that the random variable is lower than or equal to 3300 random_var.cdf(3300) # The 20th percentile fo the random variable random_var.quantile(0.2) # Generate 10 samples from the distribution of the random variable random_var.sample(10) . Random variables and distributions linked to them are some of the essential components of probabilistic programming. We will dive deeper in future posts. . Further reading . We’ve barely scratched the surface of random variables. Depending on what we are trying to describe some distributions will fit better than others. Here is a list with (mostly) all the different probability distributions. . In the TensorFlow website there’s a great variety of tutorials, and also the instructions to install this library in your computer. Similarly for Tensorflow Probability. .",
